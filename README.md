# CityCube Restaurant Website

### A fictional quick-bites restaurant that sells meal replacements

The idea for this restaurant was a dystopian society where all food is simply nutrient dense, flavorless gelatin in the shape of cubes, similar to Soylent Green.

The images were mostly sourced from Bing AI and Namelix.

The idea for a restaurant website was given by The Odin Project during their JavaScript course.
